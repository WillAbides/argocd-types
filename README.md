# argocd-types

This repository contains the exported go types from [pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1 in the argocd repository](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/tree/v2.5.4/pkg/apis/application/v1alpha1).
This is all to get around having to import the entire argocd module as a dependency just to get these types.
